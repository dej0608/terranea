Records of the adventure will be kept here in a blog style format. I happily accept volunteers who want to take notes and record these entries in my stead! These journal entries will act as a summary of the most recent session, and may occasionally contain side stories that take place outside of the continuity of the adventure. 

Please keep an eye on the journal for updates and refreshers over the course of the campaign!
