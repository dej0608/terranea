## The Circle

The gods and goddesses of the Circle are the most prevalently worshipped deities in the Holy Republic of Caius. The church of Caius is dedicated to the equal worship of all the deities of the Circle. Although some individuals may pray to a singular god for a specific purpose, organized church activities involve their shared worship. Deities of the Circle are not typically portrayed as good or evil, but as neutral conservators of their domain. The Circle takes residence in the Chalice, a floating throne that hovers miles directly above the Holy City of Caius. Caius Tower acts as a magical bridge between the Chalice and the land below through which the gods may deliver blessings upon the people. Only the Pope and those he deems worthy are allowed to cross the bridge to the Chalice.

| Deity | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| [Baras](#baras) | war, justice |
| [Demis](#demis) | magic |
| [Disynus](#disynus) | art, culture, beauty |
| [Lumos](#lumos) | light, fire, sun, healing |
| [Medall](#medall) | balance |
| [Ozros](#ozros) | knowledge, truth |
| [Thena](#thena) | nature, harvest, hunting |
| [Vevrius](#vevrius) | sea, wind |
| [Zola](#zola) | death, fate |

## Minor Deities

The worship of minor deities varies from uncommon to problematic depending on the deity. While some of these minor deities have acceptable niche domains (e.g. Hedenar for smiths and Artificers, Aktia for merchants and gamblers), some are widely considered to be evil and those who worship them are shunned by society and must practice their worship in secret. 

| Deity | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| [Aktia](#aktia) | commerce, coin |
| [Bhidal](#bhidal) | lies, trickery |
| [Grim'shak](#grimshak) | conquest |
| [Hedenar](#hedenar) | forge, ingenuity |
| [Ifradi](#ifradi) | darkness |
| [Nerath](#nerath) | dragons |
| [Telamon](#telamon) | ale, story |

## List of Deities

### Aktia
*Minor, neutral*

Aktia is a minor goddess of commerce and coin and is most commonly worshipped by merchants and tradesmen. Halflings also will often include her in their regular worship as a means of gaining her favor in attempt to garner good fortune.

### Baras
*Circle*

God of justice and honor. The patron god of the Justicars and the Protectorate. Baras is often portrayed as the people's protector, appearing in many stories as the destroyer of great monsters that threatened the world and the leader of the Celestial armies.

### Bhidal
*Minor, evil*

Bhidal, the "Father of Lies", is worshipped by a scarce few in Aeros, and only those who wish for the downfall of the church or are the most desperate for help. Bhidal is known as a schemer whose followers undermine the church's authority and actively work against the desires of the Circle.

### Demis
*Circle*

The goddess of magic, and the patron god of the Arcanus - the church sanctioned wizards of the Holy Republic of Caius. 

### Disynus
*Circle*

The goddess of art, culture, and beauty, she is commonly declared as the muse for artists, musicians, architects, and designers. The styles of the day are often attributed to her divine inspiration, and those that are considered the most inspired are sometimes awarded the coveted title of "Herald of Disynus" (often simply referred to as "Herald") for their contributions to the beautification of society.

### Grim'shak
*Minor, evil*

Grim'shak is most commmonly worshipped by the Orc and Goblin tribes that dot the continent and raid local townships. Strength is cherished by his followers above all, and signs of weakness are often a death sentence.

### Hedenar
*Minor, neutral*

Hedenar is a minor god of the forge, and is most commonly worshipped by blacksmiths, artificers, and other artisans.

### Ifradi
*Minor, evil*

Ifradi is the primary goddess of the Underdark population, who were abandoned and cursed by the Circle. Ifradi is a relatively new goddess in the greater pantheon, having come to power in the millenia since the Invasion. The denizens of the underdark are reluctant to share their stories and views, but a common prayer uttered by the Drow loosely translates to "May we be protected by her darkness such that we may endure the treachery of the light."

### Lumos
*Circle*

God of light and bringer of sunlight and flame. He is commonly viewed as the leader of the Circle and as such is the patron deity of the Church of Caius, which oversees all aspects of the Holy Republic.

### Medall
*Circle*

Medall is the god of balance and is the patron god of the Parliament. The teachings of Medall enforce the idea that all mortal lives operate in concert with one another, and if one aspect of the world falls too far out of balance, the entirety pays the price. Medall's requirement of balance ensures minimal direct interference by the gods, as it would create a mortal dependence upon it and cause more harm than good.

### Nerath
*Minor, neutral*

Nerath is known from mythology as a legendary white dragon that threatened to devour the world before Baras slew her, leaving behind her massive jaw to form the precarious mountain range known as "Nerath's Teeth". After the destruction of the dragons, dragonborn purists and kobolds began to worship the dragon Nerath as a god, in hopes that perhaps she would one day be reborn and restore their kin to their fomer glory.

### Ozros
*Circle*

God of knowledge and purveyor of truth. He is the patron god of the Guild Artifice and the Magistrates who seek truth and deliver judgement on those who would break the laws of the church. Divine technologies that are bequeathed on the people and are researched by the Aritficers are commonly called "Gifts of Ozros".

### Telamon
*Minor, good*

Telamon is the god of freedom, story, and ale (or "the master of tales and ales" as the bards say). He is most often worshipped by adventurers setting out on a dangerous journey and by bards who give thanks for those that lived to tell their tale.

### Thena
*Circle*

Thena is the goddess of the harvest, hunt, and nature. While not the patron deity of any particular organization within the Church, she is typically revered by farmers, hunters, and druidic circles across the continent. The practices of taking only what you need and leaving nature as you found it are founded in her teachings, but come into regular conflict with those who seek to expand the presence of commerce across Aeros.

### Vevrius
*Circle*

Vevrius is the god of the sea and wind, and is most commonly worshipped by pilots, sailors, pirates, and any who step aboard a vessel for transport. "Vevrius grant us strong winds and clear skies." is a common prayer said before setting sail.

### Zola
*Circle*

Zola is the goddess of fate and death who guides those who pass into the afterlife. Following the onset of the Planestorm, there was some debate about the location in which she guided the departed souls since the storm sealed off the world from the Astral Plane millenia ago. The church teaches that the devout who pass on take residence in the Chalice, awaiting the end of the storm so they may move to the next life. It is rumored that the most devout in life can be rewarded by the gods and given the opportunity to speak with their departed loved ones. This reward is a rarity reserved only for those who achieve the greatest of feats, as it requires direct divine intervention to accomplish.
