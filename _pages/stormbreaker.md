## Ship Status

The ship and its crew have a number of stats that are dependent on the party's choices and/or DM rolls that are made on a weekly basis (in-game) during downtime. 

### Ship Integrity

The ship will undergo regular wear and tear as it makes its way around the country and comes and goes from various ports. The ship requires regular maintenance, and its integrity depends on how well the crew does at maintaining it on a weekly basis (DM roll). Depending on the integrity of the ship, it will become more reliable when performing maneuvers. There are 5 levels of Ship Integrity:

| Level | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| Catastrophic | -5 |
| Poor | -2 |
| Satisfactory | +0 |
| Strong | +2 |
| Pristine | +5 |

### Crew Morale

As the ship travels, the crew becomes affected by the day-to-day drudgery of being confined on a ship - even one as large as the Stormbreaker. The morale of the crew is adjusted on a weekly basis (DM roll) and depends largely on the circumstances of the voyage along with the amenities on the ship. For example, having a poor cook onboard is likely to cause morale to drop, while having a good one will likely raise the crews spirits. If the crew's morale is high, they will be more reliable when performing ship actions and maneuvers. There are 5 levels of morale:

| Level | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| Very Low | -3 |
| Low | -1 |
| Content | +0 |
| High | +1 |
| Very High | +3 |

### Funds

Money makes the world go round, and the crew needs to get paid and fed. Hilda and Moldra take care of the ship's finances, but they can only make as much money as the ship and its reputation will allow. Upgrades to the ship will increase cash flow as more shipments can be made to more places. In addition, the player's choices can make or break a business deal - upstanding merchants may be less likely to work with a shipper that has a crew with a bad reputation. 

If the ship is unable to support all essential functions, some personnel may be let go to make ends meet, affecting morale.

### Friendship

As the party gets to know their crewmates, they will develop friendships. As they get closer, the crew might reveal parts of their past that may trigger side quests or favors that can be done to assist the party in a time of need. These friendships can develop by carousing, working, or training with them. They can also develop through significant in-game interactions outside of downtime.

### NOVA

As a new AI being, [NOVA](/loc/npcs-main/#nova) is actively learning about the world, how it works, and their place in it. NOVA's capabilities and personality will change depending on how the party acts and the choices they make. Some upgrades made to the ship may be mutually beneficial for NOVA and will expand their abilities. Likewise, some changes to the ship may be detrimental. In cases where the captain or the party are unavailable, NOVA may be forced to make choices independently, and the choice they make will be heavily dependent on what they have learned from the party.
