Since the arrival of the [Planestorm](/planestorm), the Titans have spontaneously appeared on parts of the continent where a connection to another plane would briefly coalesce. When this happens, a rift appears, opening the door through which a Titan can emerge.

The Titans are beings of immense power that seek only destruction. They seem to be void of reason, as there have been no successful attempts at communicating with them. They vary in size from medium to gargantuan, although size appears to have no correlation with their power. When they arrive, creatures called Titanspawn manifest from the overflow of the Titan's power and flood the surrounding area, consuming any living beings they can find.

There are currently five known Titans that have appeared on the continent of Aeros, each with a unique set of abilities. Titans are known to appear at irregular intervals between every 3-15 years at seemingly random locations

### Gigas

Gigas was the first Titan to appear on Aeros. Named for its colossal size and stone-like skin, it stood over 100 feet tall and had unmatched strength. It specialized in physical destruction, crushing things under foot or fist. Similarly, it's Titanspawn were giant in size, but only a fraction of the height. 

Gigas is the only Titan that has been slain - the final blow delivered by former Protectorate Commander Cedric Grayvale near the town of Oldcrest. The attack split Gigas in two, with the slash leaving a chasm in the earth now known as Dawnbringer Canyon. The remains of the Gigas are fervently studied by scientists and mages alike, looking for any clue to its origin and source of its power.

### Leviathan

Leviathan is a gargantuan snake-like creature that appears exclusively underwater, tormeting undersea settlements and port cities. Its tidal waves can level entire towns and its spawn are adept both underwater and on land. Because it appears underwater, it is not always observed first hand by the Republic. It is speculated that Leviathan has appeared during longer periods of Titan absence unbeknownst to the record-keepers.

### Jadwiga

There are very few eyewitness accounts of Jadwiga, as most who are unfortunate enough to come close enough to see her typically do not survive. Jadwiga takes the form of an average sized humanoid woman with long black hair that extends outwards in tendrils. She has total control of the elements. As such, the ruins and corpses she leaves behind vary: burned, frozen, disentegrated, and so on. Witnesses claim that those who make eye contact experience a powerful mind blast that can cause their skull to explode in an instant. The Titanspawn that emerge from her are often elemental or magical in nature.

### Myrkvior

Mryvior is a living plant that drains the life from all living beings it can get hold of. It emits fungal spores that take control of a creatures mind, creating combatants in addition to its own spawn that eventually return to the host for comsumption. The longer Myrkvior is allowed to absorb lifeforce unabated, the larger it grows.

### Prukal

There is no record of Prukals appearance, as its presence is accompanied by an all-encompassing magical darkness. Inidividuals who can see in magical darkness who return claim to never have seen the monster. The destruction Prukal leaves is unique in that there are nearly no signs of destruction to buildings and terrain. However, ghost towns are left in its wake. The living creatures that reside it the locations it appears simply disappear and are never seen again.
