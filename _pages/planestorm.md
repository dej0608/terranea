The Planestorm (or "the storm", colloquially), is a swirling storm surrounding the continent of Aeros that prevents physical entry or exit and disrupts the natural connections to other planes of existence, preventing access to any plane other than the Material. The consequences of the storm are tremendous, as everyone and everything inside is trapped - including the gods themselves.

The storm itself forms a dome that blocks out the sun. [Thena](/deities/#thena) and [Lumos](/deities/#lumos), gods of the Circle, used their magic to create a simulation of the sun and atmosphere, so that the people and creatures on the continent below could continue to survive. As a result, some believe the weather to be an indication of Thena's mood. With a functional sun and weather, one could forget they were trapped inside a storm at all were it not for the swirling clouds that rested on the horizon.

Many studies have been performed on the storm in attempt to decipher a way out or a way of disrupting it, but there are no records of success to date. People my enter the storm, but the storm immediately spits them back out - if they're lucky. Some people come back out twisted versions of their formal selves. Some never come back at all.

Early studies revealed that despite the storm's disruption of the connection to other planes, it still rests at a nexus where under the right circumstances brief conenctions to other planes can be made. Shortly thereafter it was determined that these moments carried with them a dangerous side effect in the form of powerful [Titans](/titans/) that would ravage the world where they emerged.

The Planestorm remains the focus of research conducted by the [Arcanus](/organizations/#arcanus), the church sanctioned ministry of the arcane, where they continue to investigate methods to escape or eliminate the storm.
