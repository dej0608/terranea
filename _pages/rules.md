This page lists the special rules that will be applied throughout the campaign including character creation, house rules, and homebrew. These are subject to change going forward depending on player and DM sentiment, but will be agreed upon as a group.

### Character Creation

Please use the following guidelines when creating a character:

- Campaign starts at level 1
- Ability Scores may be assigned via "Point Buy" or "Standard Array" rules
- All WotC or Darrington Press published classes and subclasses on DNDBeyond are allowed excluding:
  - Rick and Morty
  - Aquisitions Incorporated
  - Minecraft
  - Strixhaven (spells from this book are allowed, just no subclasses or feats)
- Some material will be limited (i.e. Spelljammer) because it will not make sense thematically, please ask if you want to use a background or feat that you are unsure about
- All characters must be familiar with [Hilda Skyhelm](/loc/npcs-main/#hildaskyhelm)

*[WotC]: Wizards of the Coast

In addition, after reading through some of the information in the world guide, please provide the following information or answer the following questions about your character (**please send all information directly to the DM**):
1. Please provide a brief backstory to who your character is and any relevant history that made them who they are.
2. What does your character want in life?
3. What has your character been doing until recently?
4. Are there any notable people that are important to them? If so, why are they important?
5. How does your character know [Hilda](/loc/npcs-main/#hildaskyhelm)?

Please provide as much information as desired - do not feel obligated to write a novel! These are to make my life a little easier for long term preparation, so we can always discuss more later as needed.

**DM Notes:** If you ever feel like you would like to make a change to your character's build, please let me know! Do not feel like you have to stick with a character you aren't having fun playing. I can't guarantee that you'll be able to make huge changes (for example making a full class change, or rolling back and rebuilding 10 levels worth of progress), but we can work together to find a solution that works for you! This also goes for the Homebrew rules below.
{: .notice--info}
 
### Homebrew

Any desired homebrew classes or subclasses must be approved prior to use. The player is responsible for implementing the homebrew class options into DNDBeyond. If a homebrew class results in a character being overly powerful or underwhelming, adjustments can be dicussed.

### House Rules

The house rules that will be followed for the remainder of the campaign will be documented here. This is mainly to alleviate confusion and to help your DM remember the rules they agreed to. 

*Rules will be established and agreed upon during session 0*

Candidate rules:

- Healing potions can heal for their maximum amount if a full action is used to drink it. They heal for the regular rolled amount if used as a bonus action or if feeding to another player. 
- Critical hit damage is rolled using RAW, but the target is staggered, and the person who lands the hit can decide to either:
  * Impose disadvatage on the target
  * Give advantage on the next attack against the target
- Flanking provides advantage
- New Condition: **Dazed**[^1] A dazed creature can only do one of the following things on their turn: move, use an action, or use a bonus action. If a creature becomes dazed during their turn, their turn ends. The *cure ailment* power, *lesser restoration* spell, and *greater restoration* spell remove the dazed condition. At the GM’s discretion, other powers, spells, or effects might also remove the dazed condition. When a dazed creature is affected by a spell or effect that gives them an extra action on their turn (like the haste spell or the fighter’s Action Surge feature), they can still take this extra action, in addition to the movement, action, or bonus action allowed by the dazed condition.
