This page lists the special rules that will be applied throughout the campaign including character creation, house rules, and homebrew. These are subject to change going forward depending on player and DM sentiment, but will be agreed upon as a group.

### Character Creation

Please use the following guidelines when creating a character:

- Campaign starts at level 1
- Ability Scores may be assigned via "Point Buy" or "Standard Array" rules
- All WotC or Darrington Press published classes and subclasses on DNDBeyond are allowed excluding:
  - Rick and Morty
  - Aquisitions Incorporated
  - Minecraft
  - Strixhaven (spells from this book are allowed, just no subclasses or feats)
 
If there are any further questions, the list will be appended.

**DM Notes:** If you ever feel like you would like to make a change to your character's build, please let me know! Do not feel like you have to stick with a character you aren't having fun playing. I can't guarantee that you'll be able to make huge changes (for example making a full class change, or rolling back and rebuilding 10 levels worth of progress), but we can work together to find a solution that works for you! This also goes for the Homebrew rules below.
{: .notice--info}
 
### Homebrew

Any desired homebrew classes or subclasses must be approved prior to use. The player is responsible for implementing the homebrew class options into DNDBeyond. If a homebrew class results in a character being overly powerful or underwhelming, adjustments can be dicussed.

### House Rules

The house rules that will be followed for the remainder of the campaign will be documented here. This is mainly to alleviate confusion and to help your DM remember the rules they agreed to.
