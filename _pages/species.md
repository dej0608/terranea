## Species of Terranea

People of all shapes and forms exist on the world of Terranea each with their own unique cultures and customs. Most of them live in peaceful coexistence with one another, but there are several special bits of information to consider when meeting people (or creating characters) in the world. Although, each individual's circumstances are unique, there are some broad generalizations that can be assumed about certain peoples in the world and how they are viewed by the world at-large.

**DM Notes:** All the races presented in this list are allowed for character creation. If there is a race missing from this list that is included in the WotC sourcebooks it was likely excluded purposefully (notably, Gith - they just don't exist here!). But, if you think a race was excluded in error, please let me know! Also worth noting: lineages (such as dhampir, reborn, and hexblood) are not included here because they can apply to any race. Mixed ("Half") species typically carry the benefits and detriments of both.
