## Stormbreaker Crew

### Hilda Skyhelm
*Dwarf, she/her*

Hilda was a sailor from a shipping company who had long dreamed of buying her own ship and setting out on her own. She can be a bit bullheaded, but has an overall cheerful disposition that made her a fast friend. She is an avid collector of old artifacts, and loves showing off whatever new trinket she stumbles across. In her travels she had met each of the PCs and developed a friendship with each of them prior to the beginning of the campaign. 

She sent a letter to each of them containing a skyship ticket from Geprusar to Ashborne asking them to meet her in the nearby village of Jorren's Rest. She had found a map leading to a mythical skyship, the *Harbinger*, and needed a crew to fill it. After briefly losing the map and the required gemstone to operate it, the party managed to recover it and get the long wrecked ship running once again, renaming it *Stormbreaker*.

Hilda is now the acting captain of the Stormbreaker and acts as the party's patron.

### NOVA
*AI, they/them*

</figure> 

The Nautical Operations and Vehicle Administrator (N.O.V.A.) is the AI interface to the skyship *Stormbreaker*. NOVA oversees all on-ship activities and can control aspects of the ship in the absence of a crew member, allowing the ship to operate even with an incomplete crew. They act as a caretaker for the crew, and can provide available information from any location on board the ship.

They have no memory prior to their installation in the ship and their first interaction with the party.  They were not the original intelligence that operated the ship when it was the mythical *Harbinger*. They have stated that there is minimal information available about the prior history of the ship itself.

### Kobold Krew
*Kobolds*

Eight kobolds lived in the caves adjacent to the Harbinger crash site. A friendly witch, their (["Auntie Lav"](/loc/npcs-main/#lavender-whitmore)), took care of them until her passing, at which point they began robbing people on the main road to gather food for survival. [Quentin](/loc/npcs-main/#quentin-quagmire) introduced the party to the kobolds who after some initial hesitance became fast friends.

After learning that [Hazel](/loc/pcs/#hazel-vandorin) was a "sister" to Lavender, they quickly accepted her as their new "Auntie". 

A group of very resourceful engineers using natural materials to build brilliant and convoluted traps, they now serve as crew members of the Stormbreaker and under Hilda's tutelage are learning to work with more modern materials.

Names: Boomspear, Skunkdress, Logsmush, Pitspike, Decoy, Burnynet, Hornetpot, Claptrap

### Hermann Voltz
*Human, he/him*

  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hermann_token.png" alt="">
</figure> 

The chief engineer on the ship, he leads its restoration. Deeply interested in Celestial technology and building weapons to combat the Titans, he is constantly working.

He was brought out of hiding in Port Revelry by the party to work on the ship, drawn by the prospect of working first hand on lost war era technology. He and three of his colleagues, including Hilda's mentor, Knylbec, worked together to build a cannon that gravely wounded the Titan [Jadwiga](/titans/#jadwiga) during it's last attack on Port Revelry. They were pursued by the authorities for building illegal technology, and his three comrades were arrested while Hermann managed to escape and slip into hiding. He worked with the local criminal syndicates in exchange for keeping him hidden away and out of sight of the government forces who sought to imprison him. Now finally free from the criminal groups that exploited him, he is free to pursue his personal research in earnest.

### William Adnet
*Human, he/him*

<figure style="width: 150px;height: 150px" class="align-left">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/will_token.png" alt="">
</figure> 

Teenage stepson of Hermann. His biological father died at some point around the Titan attack on Port Revelry. Although he assists Hermann in some of his tasks, he seems disinterested in pursuing a life in artificing, preferring painting and writing.

### Moldra Valnys
*Silver Dragonborn, she/her*

Cargo manager and accountant for the Stormbreaker. She is quiet and reserved and speaks little of herself, seemingly always focused on the task at hand.

### Octavian Rockforth
*Human, he/him*

Sales manager for the Stormbreaker's shipping business. Boisterous and a tad pompous, he is well aquainted with merchants in settlements all over the continent, seemingly always having an "in" somewhere. Always well dressed and quick with a smile, his way with words secured quick business in the Stormbreaker's early days.

### Urgan
*Orc, he/him*

The ship's resident blacksmith, he works closely with the ships engineering teams molding pieces and parts to replace borken ones around the crashed ship. A jack-of-all-trades, he also makes fine weapons and armor on request.

### Cronus Thunderguard
*Goliath, he/him*

Deckhand handling odd jobs around the ship. Loud and opinionated, he values strength above all else, and although he does not go looking for fights, he never turns down a good scrap.

### Skwawk
*Kenku, he/him*

Deckhand handling odd jobs around the ship. Quiet and dependable, he gets his work done with no words besides the occasional "caw". Sticks close to Cronus most of the time, who protects him like an elder brother.

### Kuzzim Duskhorn
*Dwarf, he/him*

Deckhand handling odd jobs around the ship. Grumpy and stubborn, but a dependable laborer when he recognizes "things need doin'". Currently acting as the ship's cook. He is very bad at it.

### Lenny Baldtree
*Human, he/him*

Deckhand handling odd jobs around the ship. A jokester and carouser, he previously worked as a deckhand on the *Mercurial* with Hilda until he made a snide comment about the captain's boots at which point he was thrown overboard.

## Others of Note

### Lavender Whitmore
*Human, she/her, deceased*

The witch matriarch of the kobold clan living among the old *Harbinger* ruins who passed away a few months prior to the party's arrival at the crash site. Little is known about who she was, but she lived within the ship prior to the party's arrival. Amongst her belongings was an old letter to her from a friend coming to visit that indicated she was once the Coven Mother for an unknown witch's coven.

### Tobias Armin
*Human, he/him*

</figure> 

The previous constable of Jorren's Rest who was discovered by the party to have stolen Hilda's map and gemstone after overhearing that they were needed to fly an ancient lost skyship.  He had long been accumulating funds by accepting bribes and skimming from taxes in order to fund his way out of the town and onto a skyship. He is a survivor of the titan attack on the town of Norrholm, where his parent died. He relocated to Jorren's Rest afterwards, but held on to the paranoia for the ever looming threat of a titan attack - convinced that the only way to avoid one was to be constantly on the move. To cover his tracks he regularly used the local hunters who had previously been convicted of theivery as a scapegoat.

When he moved to take the skyship for himself, he created a diversion in the town by luring wolves to cause disarray. However, upon arriving at the skyship crash site, the kobold residents caught him by surprise and held him captive. The party decided to turn him in to the Justicars in Ashborne once the ship got flying. In the meantime, the party requested the assistance of the same hunters who he had tormented during his time as Constable to help repair the ship. In exchange for their help, they were allowed a brief period of time by some party members to punish the man brutally for his wrongdoing. Allowing this to occur created a great deal of discourse betwen certain members of the party. 

Tobias is currently being held in the Stormbreaker brig.

### Quentin Quagmire
*Firbolg, he/him*

A mysterious traveling merchant who primarily serves non-traditional communities, such as the kobold residents outside of Jorren's Rest and their witch matriarch Lavender. The party met him after his squirrel companion, **Rudy**, got their attention and led them to Quentin trapped in an old hunter's bear trap. As thanks for rescuing him, he guided the party through the woods to the Harbinger crash site and introduced them to the kobold residents.

The following day he bid the party farewell, with a glint in his eye that indicated he was confident they would all someday meet again.
